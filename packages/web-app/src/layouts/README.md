# layouts/ directory

- Contains reusable Layout Components. A Layout Component is a component that composes the layout of a page. It will often import components such as app-bar, app-footer, app-side-nav.
- If your project is likely to only have a single layout, this directory might not be necessary, and the Layout Component can live in the components directory.
